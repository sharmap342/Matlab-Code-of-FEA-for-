# Matlab Code of FEA for Slope Stability
## Finite Element Code for Elasto-plastic Analysis for Slope Stability
### Description of Packages, Modules and Functions
The main package have modules such as Elastic_Master_Code, Elastoplastic_Master_Code and setpath. The module Elastic_Master_Code sets input parameters for slope stability analysis using elastic finite element method. The input parameters such as dimensions of the geometry, mesh type, material properties, initial stress conditions, boundary conditions, and number of steps for the solver are defined in this module. Similarly, Elastoplastic_Master_Code sets input parameters for slope stability analysis using elasto-plastic finite element method.      
The setpath module sets path for other modules to be called from intergratio, meshing, plotting and subfunctions packages.      
The package integrations contains modules with functions named shape function, B matrix, and gauss point. The shape function takes type, coordinate and dimension of element and returns a shape function and its derivative with respect to coordinates. The function gauss_rule provides the weight vector and gauss point coordinate matrix of the element based on the integration order selected. The function gauss_wt_pt provides the weights and coordinates of the gauss integration points. Finally, based on the shape functions and derivatives of shape functions the Bmatrix returns strain displacement matrix for each element.     
The package meshing creates a finite element mesh based on the type and dimensions of the elements provided by the user. it contains make_elem, mesh_region, mesh_t6_elem, q4totq9, q4toto8, square_node_array, structured_q8_mesh, structured_q9_mesh. The module make_elem creates a connectivity lest of primary nodes in Q4 and T3 element. The function mesh_region generates an array of nodal connectivity (coordinates of each node and element connectivity (nodes of each element with counterclockwise ordering.) given the four corners points of the domain,number of elements in each direction (numx,numy)and the element type (Q4,Q8,Q9 and T3). The module mesh_t6_elem forms the element and node matrices for T6 element, with the element and node matrices arranged in a nodal counterclockwise order (primary nodes then secondary nodes). The module q4toto8 forms the element and node matrices for eight node rectangular element, from the elemet and node matrices of a four node rectangular element with the element and node matrices arranged in a counterclockwish order Inputs:-element,node,numx and numy. The module q4totq9 forms the element and node matrices for nine node rectangular element given the elemet and node matrices of a four node rectangular element and the number of elements in x and y direction. The module square_node_array generates a quadratleral array of nodes between the counterclockwise ordering of nodes pt1 - pt4,given number of elements in x and y direction. The module structured_q8_mesh %Forms the element and node matrices for Q8 element, with the element and node matrices arranged in a nodal counterclockwise order (primary nodes then secondary nodes). The module structured_q9_mesh forms the element and node matrices for Q9 element, with the element and node matrices arranged in a nodal counterclockwise order (primary nodes-> secondary nodes then internal nodes).
